      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>We are imaginers and strategists, driven by planetary and post-biological causes. We not only conceive and design products, systems, civilizations, and worlds, but we also create art and harmless vandalism. We are something between a speculative design studio, a societal laboratory, and a distributed intelligence collective. We don't fit easily into a box, but we function as catalysts where there is purpose, chaos, and vision.</p>
